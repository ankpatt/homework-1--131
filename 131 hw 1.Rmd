Machine Learning Main Ideas: 

1. Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?


Supervised learning relies on the response variable when unsupervised learning does not. That is the main difference between the two, the factor of having a response variable. In supervised learning, each predictor has a response or expected response when in unsupervised there is a lack of response variable that would usually supervise the analysis. 


2. Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.


The difference splits up the categorical methods of quantitative and qualitative variables. Simply, quantitative or numerical variables are categorized as regression problems and qualitative or descriptive variables are categorized as classification models. In the context of machine learning, it is important to distinguish which model to use so that you can set up, or "code", the problem correctly for accurate analysis. The textbook talks about how these models can be used in K-nearest models, or boosting which are elaborated in further chapters. (Page 28-29).


3. Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.





4. As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

Descriptive models:

Inferential models:

Predictive models:


5. Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?

In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.


6. A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.
